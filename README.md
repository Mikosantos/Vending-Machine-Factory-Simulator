**About**:  
In this project, as the title suggests, the program proper simulates a Vending Machine Factory where the user has given two options to first create either “Regular” or “Special” Vending Machine. Furthermore, the user has also been given an option to choose to explore either “Vending” or “Maintenance” features. Come with these are similar functionalities in Vending Feature between the two such as seeing current inventory, means to pay, dispense an item- pre-made and custom-made meal in “Special” vending machine- getting the change and getting the calorie amount of the product dispensed.  On the other hand, for Maintenance Feature, both share the same functionalities such as restocking the inventory, changing price of a product, collecting total profit, replenishing cash on the vending machine,and generating transaction summaries. 
This machine project was a partial fulfillment for the course requirements in CCPROG3, “Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming” in De La Salle University. This version of the machine project has been remodified and rechecked for further enhancement. 


**To run**:
- Type "javac VendingMachineFactory.java" on cmd to compile
- Type "VendingMachineFactory.java" to run the program with GUI
